It involves training a model to learn from labeled data, where the input data has corresponding output labels. Once the model is trained, it can categorize new, unseen data into predefined classes.\n\nSubtopics:  \n1. **Labeled Data**: Classification requires datasets where each input is paired with a known output label, such as \"cat\" or \"dog\" in an image dataset. This labeled data is used for training the model.  \n\n2. **Types of Classification**: Classification tasks can be binary (two classes, e.g., \"spam\" or \"not spam\") or multi-class (more than two classes, e.g., \"apple,\" \"banana,\" \"cherry\").  \n\n3. **Common Algorithms**: Popular algorithms for classification include Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and Neural Networks, each suited for different types of problems.  \n---","refusal":null,"annotations":[]},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":86,"completion_tokens":222,"total_tokens":308,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}},"system_fingerprint":"fp_ee1d74bde0"}
