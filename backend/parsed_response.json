  "overview": "---\nOverview:  \nClassification in Machine Learning (ML) is a type of supervised learning where the goal is to predict the category or class of a given data point. It involves training a model to learn from labeled data, where the input data has corresponding output labels. Once the model is trained, it can categorize new, unseen data into predefined classes.",
